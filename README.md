# Strategy-Game 
I started working on this project while I was deeply immersed in playing strategy games like Civilization V, Hearts of Iron IV, and Europa Universalis IV. At the same time, I was exploring procedural generation, which got me thinking about the challenges of making a game like this. While it's unlikely that I'll ever bring this project to completion, the journey proved immensely captivating, offering me significant insights and enjoyment along the way.

Though there are a few bugs associated with the "buy land" option, the rest of the project functions as intended, showcasing the culmination of my efforts and experimentation.
